##Northern Lights
Aurora Borealis "pazori" is the glow (luminescence) of the upper layers of the planets' atmospheres, resulting from the interaction of the planet's magnetosphere with charged particles of the solar wind.



The nature of the phenomenon



In a very limited area of the upper atmosphere, auroras can be caused by low-energy charged particles of the solar wind entering the polar ionosphere through the northern and southern polar casps. In the northern hemisphere, the Caspian lights can be observed over Svalbard in the afternoon.



When energetic particles of the plasma layer collide with the upper atmosphere, the atoms and molecules of gases that make up it are excited. The radiation of excited atoms is in the visible range and is observed as the aurora borealis. The spectra of auroras depend on the composition of the atmospheres of the planets: for example, if the emission lines of excited oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the visible range are the brightest for the Earth, then for Jupiter — the emission lines of hydrogen in the ultraviolet.



Since ionization by charged particles occurs most efficiently at the end of the particle path and the density of the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude in accordance with the barometric formula, the height of the appearance of auroras strongly depends on the parameters of the planet's atmosphere, so, for the Earth with its rather complex atmospheric composition, the red glow of oxygen is observed at altitudes of 200-400 km, and the combined glow of nitrogen and oxygen — at an altitude of ~ 110 km. In addition, these factors determine the shape of the auroras — blurred upper and rather sharp lower boundaries.
