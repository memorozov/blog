##Creating presentations



##C++



C++ (pronounced "c plus plus") is a compiled statically typed general—purpose programming language. Supporting different programming paradigms, it combines the properties of both high-level and low-level languages. In comparison with its predecessor, the C language, the greatest attention is paid to the support of object-oriented and generalized programming. The name "C++" comes from the C language, in which the unary operator ++ denotes the increment of a variable.



Being one of the most popular programming languages, C++ is widely used for software development. Its scope of application includes operating systems, application programs, device drivers, embedded system applications, high-performance servers, as well as entertainment applications, such as video games. There are several implementations of the language, both free and commercial. They are produced by GNU Project, Microsoft, Intel and Embarcadero (Borland). C++ has had a huge impact on other programming languages, primarily C# and Java.



When creating C++, we tried to maintain compatibility with the C language. Most C programs will work properly with the C++ compiler. C++ has a syntax based on C syntax.



##History

The language originated in the early 1980s, when Bjorn Stroustrup, an employee of Bell Laboratories, came up with a number of improvements to the C language for his own needs. Prior to the official standardization, the language was developed mainly by Stroustrup in response to requests from the programming community. In 1998, the international standard of the C++ language was ratified: ISO/IEC 14882:1998 "Standard for the C++ Programming Language"; after the adoption of technical corrections to the standard in 2003, the current version of this standard is ISO/IEC 14882:2003.



##Philosophy

In the book "Design and Evolution of C++", Bjorn Stroustrup describes the principles he followed when designing C++. These principles explain why C++ is exactly the way it is. Some of them are:



Get a universal language with static data types, efficiency and portability of the C language.



Directly and comprehensively support a variety of programming styles, including procedural programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming and generalized programming.



Give the programmer freedom of choice, even if it gives him the opportunity to choose incorrectly.



To preserve compatibility with C as much as possible, thereby making possible an easy transition from programming to C.



To avoid discrepancies between C and C++: any construction allowed in both languages should mean the same thing in each of them and lead to the same behavior of the program.



Avoid features that depend on the platform or are not universal.



No language tool should lead to a decrease in the performance of programs that do not use it.



Do not require an overly complicated programming environment.
