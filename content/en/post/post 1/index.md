##Educational activity of the 1st week



##OS



After 4 laboratory work on the OS, I realized that it was enough to devote a small amount of my time to achieve the goal of 51 points. Roughly speaking, I have to study 14 topics, test the theory in practice and make a report. Since I don't like to waste my time on mechanical work, I created cheat sheets for myself on reports with the help of which my productivity improved. By the end of the first week, I managed to do 6 laboratory work and 1 stage of an individual project, as I wanted to study it without deadlines and for my own pleasure. Thanks to templates with an extension .md for reports and presentations, I'm starting to enjoy forming my reports and presentations.

I believe that I can go through all the stages of an individual project in a couple of days. I will not be discouraged. I will continue to go to my goal.



##TP



In addition to the OS, I have other subjects, programming technologies pushed me to study C++ in more detail. I think I can do the first lab work, but it will require some effort from me.



##CA



Computer algebra seems like a simple subject, but I don't think everything will be easy. 05/18/2022 - The date of the first test, I hope it will not be very difficult, but the extensive functionality of the maxim says the opposite.



##PE



What can be difficult with physical education ? Nothing. But my visits said the opposite, in order to pass this subject, I can no longer skip classes, I hope I will succeed and there will be no physical education debt.



##Eng				

Everything is simple with English, you go and get points. You answer, you get points. You do your homework, you get points. You type the necessary ones and study English for your own pleasure.
