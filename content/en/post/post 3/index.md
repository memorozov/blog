##Educational activity of the 1st week

## My condition and why I feel terrible.

It's my birthday in 3 days, but I don't feel any joy. I don't know why, it seems I just need to rest and continue living without losing optimism. It seems that this blog is the only place where I can share my experiences.



##OS

I need to work hard and hard to successfully complete my OS course. I want to get 51 points and calmly enter the second year of study, for this I need to attend an OS class on Tuesday. I have to move myself and wake up at 6:30 to make it. I also need to do 9.10 lab work to get enough points. I will try to get the maximum points that I can get, it's a shame that I started doing an individual project so late, the upcoming stages turned out to be very simple.



##TP

Most of all, I want to successfully pass the laboratory work. I need to refine my program so that everything works perfectly. I think I will succeed, I need to not be discouraged and try.



##CA

Today is 05/18/2022. Computer algebra was the first test paper. It wasn't difficult, but I had to try to answer all the tasks. As expected, the work will not be checked instantly. I am waiting for my assessment and hope for the best.I am confident in 3 tasks out of 5, and this is 12 points, not terrible, but also not the best result.



##PE

There are 3 (2) classes left, the stage of passing the standards has begun. I need to attend all the remaining physical education classes, I think I will succeed. I need to train more to successfully complete my first year of physical education.



##Eng

With English, everything is fine, I regularly go to classes and I think I already have enough points, but on June 3rd I have to attend the final exam in this subject, I think I will succeed.
