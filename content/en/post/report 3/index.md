##Creating presentations



##Presentation



Presentation (from Lat. praesento — presentation) is a document or set of documents intended to represent something (organization, project, product, etc.). The purpose of the presentation is to convey to the audience full information about the object of the presentation in a convenient form. Presentation is one of the marketing and PR tools.



##Information search

To find information, the speaker should carefully study the topic of his/her presentation. After that, he must decide which sources he will need to search for information. After analyzing the necessary information, it is recommended to create a plan for your speech and prepare a text for your speech. The text of the speech should be more detailed than the text on the presentation slides.





##Design

Design (from the English design — to design, draw, conceive, as well as a project, plan, drawing) is the activity of designing the aesthetic properties of industrial products ("artistic design"), as well as the result of this activity (for example, in such phrases as "car design"). With the help of photos selected for his presentation and built-in design editorial tools, the speaker can design his unique personal design using templates.



##Slides				

Slides are so-called components of a presentation, are one of the main components of a presentation. They are the ones who make up the presentation.
